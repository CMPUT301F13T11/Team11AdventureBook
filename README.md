In the 1970s and 1980s Choose Your Own Adventure books were very popular. They were paperback novels which had fragments of stories of scattered across pages. On the bottom of each page was a choice or an ending.

Once you read the fragment which often projected you into a mystical world fraught with peril, you could choose what you could do next. This was done by giving you a list of choices with page numbers. You would then navigate to that page and carry on your adventure.

Sometimes the pages were illustrated.

I want a system where users can create, collaborate, and build their own choose your own adventure story.

I want a system where new choices can be added at any time.

I want a system where stories can be accompanied by images, or videos, or sounds.

I want a system where a user can browse available stories to explore.

I want a system where users can add-on to existing stories.

I would be nice if I could cache some of the stories to read them offline. Needs in (Partial) User Story Form
